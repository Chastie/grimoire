Passes the given strings to Runtime.exec() to launch a sub-process.Options are:in      may be given followed by any legal input source forclojure.java.io/copy, e.g. InputStream, Reader, File, byte[],or String, to be fed to the sub-process's stdin.:in-enc  option may be given followed by a String, used as a characterencoding name (for example "UTF-8" or "ISO-8859-1") toconvert the input string specified by the :in option to thesub-process's stdin.  Defaults to UTF-8.If the :in option provides a byte array, then the bytes are passedunencoded, and this option is ignored.:out-enc option may be given followed by :bytes or a String. If aString is given, it will be used as a character encodingname (for example "UTF-8" or "ISO-8859-1") to convertthe sub-process's stdout to a String which is returned.If :bytes is given, the sub-process's stdout will be storedin a byte array and returned.  Defaults to UTF-8.:env     override the process env with a map (or the underlying JavaString[] if you are a masochist).:dir     override the process dir with a String or java.io.File.You can bind :env or :dir for multiple operations using with-sh-envand with-sh-dir.sh returns a map of:exit => sub-process's exit code:out  => sub-process's stdout (as byte[] or String):err  => sub-process's stderr (String via platform default encoding)
