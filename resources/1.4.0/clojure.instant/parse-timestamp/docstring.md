Parse a string containing an RFC3339-like like timestamp.The function new-instant is called with the following arguments.min  max           default---  ------------  -------years          0           9999      N/A (s must provide years)months         1             12        1days           1             31        1 (actual max days dependshours          0             23        0  on month and year)minutes        0             59        0seconds        0             60        0 (though 60 is only validnanoseconds    0      999999999        0  when minutes is 59)offset-sign   -1              1        0offset-hours   0             23        0offset-minutes 0             59        0These are all integers and will be non-nil. (The listed defaults
will be passed if the corresponding field is not present in s.)Grammar (of s):date-fullyear   = 4DIGITdate-month      = 2DIGIT  ; 01-12date-mday       = 2DIGIT  ; 01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31 based on; month/yeartime-hour       = 2DIGIT  ; 00-23time-minute     = 2DIGIT  ; 00-59time-second     = 2DIGIT  ; 00-58, 00-59, 00-60 based on leap second; rulestime-secfrac    = '.' 1*DIGITtime-numoffset  = ('+' / '-') time-hour ':' time-minutetime-offset     = 'Z' / time-numoffsettime-part       = time-hour [ ':' time-minute [ ':' time-second[time-secfrac] [time-offset] ] ]timestamp       = date-year [ '-' date-month [ '-' date-mday[ 'T' time-part ] ] ]Unlike RFC3339:- we only parse the timestamp format- timestamp can elide trailing components- time-offset is optional (defaults to +00:00)Though time-offset is syntactically optional, a missing time-offset
will be treated as if the time-offset zero (+00:00) had been
specified.
