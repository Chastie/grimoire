binding => var-symbol temp-value-exprTemporarily redefines Vars while executing the body.  Thetemp-value-exprs will be evaluated and each resulting value willreplace in parallel the root value of its Var.  After the body isexecuted, the root values of all the Vars will be set back to theirold values.  These temporary changes will be visible in all threads.Useful for mocking out functions during testing.
