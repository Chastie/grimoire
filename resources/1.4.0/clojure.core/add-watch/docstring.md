Alpha - subject to change.Adds a watch function to an agent/atom/var/ref reference. The watchfn must be a fn of 4 args: a key, the reference, its old-state, itsnew-state. Whenever the reference's state might have been changed,any registered watches will have their functions called. The watch fnwill be called synchronously, on the agent's thread if an agent,before any pending sends if agent or ref. Note that an atom's orref's state may have changed again prior to the fn call, so useold/new-state rather than derefing the reference. Note also that watchfns may be called from multiple threads simultaneously. Var watchersare triggered only by root binding changes, not thread-localset!s. Keys must be unique per reference, and can be used to removethe watch with remove-watch, but are otherwise considered opaque bythe watch mechanism.
