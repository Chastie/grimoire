Takes an expression, and a set of clauses.Each clause can take the form of either:test-constant result-expr(test-constant1 ... test-constantN)  result-exprThe test-constants are not evaluated. They must be compile-timeliterals, and need not be quoted.  If the expression is equal to atest-constant, the corresponding result-expr is returned. A singledefault expression can follow the clauses, and its value will bereturned if no clause matches. If no default expression is providedand no clause matches, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.Unlike cond and condp, case does a constant-time dispatch, theclauses are not considered sequentially.  All manner of constantexpressions are acceptable in case, including numbers, strings,symbols, keywords, and (Clojure) composites thereof. Note that sincelists are used to group multiple constants that map to the sameexpression, a vector can be used to match a list if needed. Thetest-constants need not be all of the same type.
