Creates and returns a Ref with an initial value of x and zero ormore options (in any order)::meta metadata-map:validator validate-fn:min-history (default 0):max-history (default 10)If metadata-map is supplied, it will be come the metadata on theref. validate-fn must be nil or a side-effect-free fn of oneargument, which will be passed the intended new state on any statechange. If the new state is unacceptable, the validate-fn shouldreturn false or throw an exception. validate-fn will be called ontransaction commit, when all refs have their final values.Normally refs accumulate history dynamically as needed to deal withread demands. If you know in advance you will need history you canset :min-history to ensure it will be available when first needed (insteadof after a read fault). History is limited, and the limit can be setwith :max-history.
