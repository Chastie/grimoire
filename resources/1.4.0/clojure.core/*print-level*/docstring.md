*print-level* controls how many levels deep the printer willprint nested objects. If it is bound to logical false, there is nolimit. Otherwise, it must be bound to an integer indicating the maximumlevel to print. Each argument to print is at level 0; if an argument is acollection, its items are at level 1; and so on. If an object is acollection and is at a level greater than or equal to the value bound to*print-level*, the printer prints '#' to represent it. The root bindingis nil indicating no limit.
