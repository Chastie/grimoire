Alpha - subject to change.Reflect on a typeref, returning a map with :bases, :flags, and:members. In the discussion below, names are always Clojure symbols.:bases            a set of names of the type's bases:flags            a set of keywords naming the boolean attributesof the type.:members          a set of the type's members. Each membrer is a mapand can be a constructor, method, or field.Keys common to all members::name             name of the type :declaring-class  name of the declarer:flags            keyword naming boolean attributes of the memberKeys specific to constructors::parameter-types  vector of parameter type names:exception-types  vector of exception type namesKey specific to methods::parameter-types  vector of parameter type names:exception-types  vector of exception type names:return-type      return type nameKeys specific to fields::type             type nameOptions::ancestors     in addition to the keys described above, alsoinclude an :ancestors key with the entire set ofancestors, and add all ancestor members to:members.:reflector     implementation to use. Defaults to JavaReflector,AsmReflector is also an option.
