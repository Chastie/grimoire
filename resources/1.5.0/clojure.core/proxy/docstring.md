class-and-interfaces - a vector of class namesargs - a (possibly empty) vector of arguments to the superclassconstructor.f => (name [params*] body) or(name ([params*] body) ([params+] body) ...)Expands to code which creates a instance of a proxy class thatimplements the named class/interface(s) by calling the suppliedfns. A single class, if provided, must be first. If not provided itdefaults to Object.The interfaces names must be valid interface types. If a method fnis not provided for a class method, the superclass methd will becalled. If a method fn is not provided for an interface method, anUnsupportedOperationException will be thrown should it becalled. Method fns are closures and can capture the environment inwhich proxy is called. Each method fn takes an additional implicitfirst arg, which is bound to 'this. Note that while method fns canbe provided to override protected methods, they have no other accessto protected members, nor to super, as these capabilities cannot beproxied.
