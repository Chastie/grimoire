When compiling, generates compiled bytecode for an interface withthe given package-qualified :name (which, as all names in theseparameters, can be a string or symbol), and writes the .class fileto the *compile-path* directory.  When not compiling, does nothing.In all subsequent sections taking types, the primitive types can bereferred to by their Java names (int, float etc), and classes in thejava.lang package can be used without a package qualifier. All otherclasses must be fully qualified.Options should be a set of key/value pairs, all except for :name areoptional::name anameThe package-qualified name of the class to be generated:extends [interface ...]One or more interfaces, which will be extended by this interface.:methods [ [name [param-types] return-type], ...]This parameter is used to specify the signatures of the methods ofthe generated interface.  Do not repeat superinterface signatureshere.
