Reduces an associative collection. f should be a function of 3arguments. Returns the result of applying f to init, the first keyand the first value in coll, then applying f to that result and the2nd key and value, etc. If coll contains no entries, returns initand f is not called. Note that reduce-kv is supported on vectors,where the keys will be the ordinals.
