Map from reader tag symbols to data reader Vars.When Clojure starts, it searches for files named 'data_readers.clj'at the root of the classpath. Each such file must contain a literalmap of symbols, like this:{foo/bar my.project.foo/barfoo/baz my.project/baz}The first symbol in each pair is a tag that will be recognized bythe Clojure reader. The second symbol in the pair is thefully-qualified name of a Var which will be invoked by the reader toparse the form following the tag. For example, given thedata_readers.clj file above, the Clojure reader would parse thisform:#foo/bar [1 2 3]by invoking the Var #'my.project.foo/bar on the vector [1 2 3]. Thedata reader function is invoked on the form AFTER it has been readas a normal Clojure data structure by the reader.Reader tags without namespace qualifiers are reserved forClojure. Default reader tags are defined inclojure.core/default-data-readers but may be overridden indata_readers.clj or by rebinding this Var.
