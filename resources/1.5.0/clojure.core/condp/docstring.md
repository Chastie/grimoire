Takes a binary predicate, an expression, and a set of clauses.Each clause can take the form of either:test-expr result-exprtest-expr :>> result-fnNote :>> is an ordinary keyword.For each clause, (pred test-expr expr) is evaluated. If it returnslogical true, the clause is a match. If a binary clause matches, theresult-expr is returned, if a ternary clause matches, its result-fn,which must be a unary function, is called with the result of thepredicate as its argument, the result of that call being the returnvalue of condp. A single default expression can follow the clauses,and its value will be returned if no clause matches. If no defaultexpression is provided and no clause matches, anIllegalArgumentException is thrown.
