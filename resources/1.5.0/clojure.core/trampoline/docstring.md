trampoline can be used to convert algorithms requiring mutualrecursion without stack consumption. Calls f with supplied args, ifany. If f returns a fn, calls that fn with no arguments, andcontinues to repeat, until the return value is not a fn, thenreturns that non-fn value. Note that if you want to return a fn as afinal value, you must wrap it in some data structure and unpack itafter trampoline returns.
