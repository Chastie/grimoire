Also reader macro: @ref/@agent/@var/@atom/@delay/@future/@promise. Within a transaction,returns the in-transaction-value of ref, else returns themost-recently-committed value of ref. When applied to a var, agentor atom, returns its current state. When applied to a delay, forcesit if not already forced. When applied to a future, will block ifcomputation not complete. When applied to a promise, will blockuntil a value is delivered.  The variant taking a timeout can beused for blocking references (futures and promises), and will returntimeout-val if the timeout (in milliseconds) is reached before avalue is available.
