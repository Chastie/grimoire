Defines a test function with no arguments.  Test functions may callother tests, so tests may be composed.  If you compose tests, youshould also define a function named test-ns-hook; run-tests willcall test-ns-hook instead of testing all vars.Note: Actually, the test body goes in the :test metadata on the var,and the real function (the value of the var) calls test-var onitself.When *load-tests* is false, deftest is ignored.
