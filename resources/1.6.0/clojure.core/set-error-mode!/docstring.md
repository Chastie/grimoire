Sets the error-mode of agent a to mode-keyword, which must beeither :fail or :continue.  If an action being run by the agentthrows an exception or doesn't pass the validator fn, anerror-handler may be called (see set-error-handler!), after which,if the mode is :continue, the agent will continue as if neither theaction that caused the error nor the error itself ever happened.If the mode is :fail, the agent will become failed and will stopaccepting new 'send' and 'send-off' actions, and any previouslyqueued actions will be held until a 'restart-agent'.  Deref willstill work, returning the state of the agent before the error.
