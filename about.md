title: About

Grimoire was hacked in 24hrs by [Reid McKenzie](http://arrdem.com/)
and [César Bolaños](https://github.com/cesarbp), and serves to provide
web documentation of the [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) language with
community contributed commentary and examples.

Since then, Grimoire has continued to evolve and now features examples
sourced from [ClojureDocs](http://clojuredocs.org) as well as user
submitted content.

Check out the github repository linked in the sidebar for more
information as well as the state of the project and work in progress
changes.
