Developer Notes
===============

To serve up a local copy of grimoire, install [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/): `gem install
jekyll`. To run a server which translates the templates to html (there's some lag as
there are a number of templates to build): `jekyll serve -V`.

To rebuild most of the site e.g. examples and index page : `lein run`

To build the cheatsheet home page: `./cheatsheet.sh`
